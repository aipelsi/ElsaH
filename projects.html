            <h3>Car Loan Price Estimation</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose and Situation:</strong> We will review and examine the business model and past data to determine if e-cars could potentially generate higher profits through auto car loans. According to the case study, e-car has encountered difficulties in obtaining loan acceptance from potential customers. Upon reviewing the case data, it became apparent that e-cars were offering considerably higher interest rates to customers deemed risky, placing them in a higher risk tier. We believe that e-car may have been overpricing its loans, significantly exceeding market rates for car loans. In today's competitive business landscape, e-cars must competitively price their offerings while also mitigating risk and minimizing losses.</p>
            <p>Upon brief data exploration, it became evident that the acceptance rate of e-car loans was unusually low. Out of the 208,077 loans offered, only 45,785 were accepted, resulting in a 22% acceptance rate (Fig.1). We propose that e-car's objective should be to achieve an acceptance rate of over 50%. Several areas for improvement have been identified:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increasing the number of customer segments to better tailor prices and risk factors.</li>
                <li>Optimizing the term by observing trends and preference of accepted loans.</li>
                <li>Establishing an optimal price point those balances profit margins with transaction volume.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have decided to address this issue using both value-based and cost-based pricing strategies. Value-based pricing entails quoting fair prices and providing seamless service from start to finish. Cost-based pricing will enable us to determine the best pricing strategy, ensuring that we neither miss opportunities by overpricing nor undercut potential profits by underpricing the loans.</p>
            <h3>Task:</h3>
            <p>After exploring the data further, we were able to gain more insight into the possible areas of improvement. With so many factors to consider, e-car needs to identify what are the important factors in decision making while customers are shopping for car loans.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Considering lowering APR to match competitor’s rate, general market rate (Fig.6).</li>
                <li>Offer Longer terms on loans (Fig.3).</li>
                <li>Make “new” car loans attractive since that was the least accepted loan type (Fig.2).</li>
                <li>Offer more online and billboard ads to retain customers.</li>
            </ul>
