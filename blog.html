        <h3>Microsoft Azure Analysis: The Intersection of AI & Microsoft’s Cloud Business Evolution</h3>
        <p>Microsoft has fully incorporated advanced AI algorithms and applications in the products and services it offers at the present time. In this article, we will review the impact of integrating AI in Microsoft cloud services business, Microsoft Azure, and how it’s affecting Microsoft business structure.
