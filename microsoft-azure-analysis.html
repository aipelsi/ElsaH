        <p>Microsoft has fully incorporated advanced AI algorithms and applications in the products and services it offers at the present time. In this article, we will review the impact of integrating AI in Microsoft cloud services business, Microsoft Azure, and how it’s affecting Microsoft business structure. Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). Microsoft Azure went live in 2010 and it has come a long way since then. AI, on the other hand, refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly through the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Microsoft has been slowly integrating AI into its services over the past few years and has been and is one of the first movers in the AI/ML applications. Microsoft has been on the forefront of the AI revolution for the last few years and possibly dictate the future in the upcoming years.</p>

        <p>It's worthy to note that having a solid business strategy and overall mission is fundamental in attaining success in any business venture. This concept is not novel to the past, present leaders and CEOs in Microsoft. To benefit from any new product, crafting a strong business strategy along with model is necessary. Microsoft first integrated AI to its cloud services by soft introduction in 2014. Following that there was a constant upgrade of the service with more AI abilities. From 2019 onwards there has been exponential growth in the AI/ML aided cloud applications and services deployed by Microsoft. The slow introduction, followed by exponential expansion in the AI sector has allowed Microsoft to dominate and shape the direction of AI. In addition to that Microsoft has managed to get ahead by carefully attenuating and controlling the timing of releasing new products, monitoring external and internal forces and investing in the right leadership.</p>

        <p>Integrating AI to Microsoft Azure (Cloud Computing)
        Microsoft Azure stands as a leader in the realm of cloud computing and is catering to diverse technological needs across the world. Microsoft began integrating AI capabilities into Azure several years ago by heavily investing in AI/ML research in 2010s. The development and integration of AI services and tools in Azure has been an ongoing process, with new features and offerings being introduced progressively. 
        Azure Machine Learning (AML) Service was introduced in 2014, this marked one of the initial steps in integrating AI capabilities into Azure. It’s worth noting that this was initiated under Satya Nadella’s oversight right after he became Microsoft CEO in 2014. Following that, Microsoft has introduced many products that incorporate AI technologies. Some of the applications include Azure Cognitive Services (2015), Azure Bot Service (2016), Azure Databricks (2018), OpenAI Partnership (2019), Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse) Enhancements (2020).</p>

        <p>The year 2019-2020 was a key Milestone in Microsoft Azure timeline and the future AI work. Along with open AI partnership, Microsoft announced that it has built one of the top five publicly disclosed supercomputers, this made a new infrastructure available in Azure to train extremely large artificial intelligence models. This supercomputer developed for OpenAI is a single system with more than 285,000 CPU cores, 10,000 GPUs and 400 gigabits per second of network connectivity for each GPU server. In January 2023, Amazon announced that Azure OpenAI service is available for customers to utilize.</p>

        <p>Navigating the Cloud Business
        Microsoft has been open about using its services for social good as a greater mission. They have made it clear that their goal is to make computing open for all. In addition to boosting cloud storage and data processing for sizable companies, it offers Individuals users and developers enhanced computing and search ability with the emergence of products like ChatGPT. Microsoft is constantly conveying the message that although profit is essential for the business’s growth, it’s not the only mission on their agenda but rather having an open and accessible AI application is far more advantageous to the public in a greater scale. Giving people access to a powerful tool that has never been experienced before will certainly elicit a positive attitude of Microsoft. In addition to that Microsoft offers a variety of affordable options for smaller and upcoming companies.</p>

        <p>Even though Microsoft has been the first mover in the AI industry, it’s not free of competitors. In fact, Microsoft Azure had to fight keep up with Amazon AWS and Google. Amazon along with Google, had entered cloud computing in 2000, almost 10 years before Microsoft Azure was established in 2010. During the first few years, Azure had to play catch up in cloud computing due to its later entrance to cloud computing. Amazon had better infrastructure, capital and was further in the path because of the more scalable services. With the integration of ML and AI, Microsoft was able to tailor its business in a way that it offered similar services in different methods. Meaning Azure focused on bettering the functions where AWS and other cloud providers lacked. Microsoft made its service powerful by improving scalability, efficiency, speed, hybrid capabilities and providing unparallel security/privacy. Azure was doubted by many market critics if it would be able to catch up with AWS but by focusing on the areas where other cloud providers lacked and being able to invest in and integrate AI better, Azure is at the forefront of cloud computing challenging AWS in the cloud industry.</p>
